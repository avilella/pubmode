Installation instructions
=========================

Quick-start
-----------

Add the 3 lines to .emacs and everything should be ready for use
(replace ~/some/dir with the appropriate location):

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/some/directory/PubMode/lisp")
(autoload 'pub-med "pub" "PubMed Interface for Emacs" t)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'pub-med)


Details
-------

For PubMode to work correctly, the files ending in *el in the lisp
sub-directory must reside in a location where Emacs can find
them. More precisely the location must be listed in the "load-path"
variable. 

You can either copy the files to a path that is already in the
"load-path" (e.g. "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp") or add a new
path yourself. For the latter, you have to add the following line in
your .emacs configuration file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/some/directory/PubMode-0.1/lisp")


To make the command "M-x pub-med" available you need to tell Emacs
that it exists and where the code can be found. Add the following
line to .emacs:

(autoload 'pub-med "pub" "PubMed Interface for Emacs" t)

If you plan to use PubMed searches regularly you can define a
short-key. The following line binds the keys Control-C-p to the
pub-med command:

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'pub-med)


Proxy settings
--------------

If you want (or must) access the internet through a proxy-server you
have to tell Emacs to do so.  Run "M-x customize-variable" on the
variable "url-proxy-services". In the customization menu, put in the
address of your http-proxy and save the settings.
